This document describes the structure, purpose, and features of my personal portfolio website. The project highlights my work as a UI designer and front-end developer, as well as my background, skills, and selected creative projects. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses Laravel Blade for templating, routing, and asset management.
